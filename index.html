      A Special Thank You

    <p>It's difficult to summarize my time here at CGI on the websites team. I have worked on some projects I love as well as some projects that were intimidating to begin. I have witnessed an inspirational, team-wide transformation. I remember the days when #oneteam meant one painfully long scrum meeting. There's almost no way to compare the state of our team now to the one we were 3 years ago. Even though our team has always embraced change, one thing has remained constant: the ability to foster learning. Without that, I don't believe I would be where I am today. To everyone who has ever hosted a training, answered my (probably repeat) questions, and remained patient during the whole thing: <strong>Thank you</strong>.</p>
    <p>I hope to return some day with new skills and see how much the team has evolved from today.</p>
